    <h1>All About Saline</h1>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.cityofsaline.org/">Saline</a> is a small town located in Washtenaw County in southeast
        Michigan. It's where I grew up and where I still reside to this day.

    <h3>A Brief History</h3>
    <p>
        Before the 18th century, Native Americans often traveled here to hunt wildlife and gather salt from the nearby
        salt springs. During the 18th century, French explorers traveled here via canoes to collect the salt. They named
        the local river Saline, meaning "salty" in French. Europeans settled here during the 19th century, mostly from
        England and Germany. Together with Orange Risdon, a government surveyor who is generally considered to be the
        city's founder, the residents named the town Saline, which was officially established in 1832.
        <br><br>
        In 1870, railroad service, provided by the Detroit-Hillsdale-&-Indiana Railroad, first reached Saline. In 1875,
        Salinians built one of the city's most famous landmarks, the Second-Empire frame, ​2 1⁄2-story residential
        building, the Davenport House (a.k.a. Curtis Mansion). The town continued to grow, and in 1931 the Village of
        Saline became the City of Saline. The Saline Fisheries Research Station was built on the site of a pioneer grist
        mill. The city of Saline had its own newspaper since ca. 1874 but the Saline Reporter was shuttered by its
        owner, Digital First Media, in 2014. The Saline Post, an independent outlet, now serves the community.
